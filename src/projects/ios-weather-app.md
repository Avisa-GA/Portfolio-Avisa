My project is iOS weather mobile app, that shows every 24 hours, 7 days & current weather forecast, and 
if one city weather forecast is your favorite and you press <strong>favorite</strong> button, it will be your default page.
<br/>
This is a project where I was able to get my degree in iOS Development with Swift from <strong>[RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/)</strong>.
