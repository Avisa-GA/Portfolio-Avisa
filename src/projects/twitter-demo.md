My project is a Demo of Twitter website, Users were able to share their thoughts with each other, also share photos, and comment on each other's tweet and like it . I also add a news summary on the main page, users can read the world news headlines. Thank you to my Instructor
<strong>[Daniel Scott](https://danieljs.dev/)</strong> for offering me great features to add to my project and also for his amazing workshops ðŸ’«
